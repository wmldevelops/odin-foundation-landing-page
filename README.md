# odin-foundation-landing-page
TOP foundation project: Landing page
For this project Iâ€™ll be creating an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project. This will use the skills learned so far during the course, including HTML CSS and Flexbox. Efficient use of Git and Github are also required.

Once in the flow of things, the project moved quite smoothly. With some things, although lessons made them seem simple, the application was more troublesome in a real world setting.

The landing page is as per the Odin Project specification, but I feel there is more I can do to enhance the page with media queries, and better application of dynamic flex.
The CSS works, but i feel is 'messier' than it should be. Further research into CSS conventions and ordering is required.

Also, although this was one page, I feel i should be using Git more often to track my flow and changes.
